# Subway for TextMate & Sublime Text

Since most subway maps feature a color palette optimized for readability on bright backgrounds, I wanted to translate them into a color schemes for TextMate and Sublime Text. Here are color schemes inspired by subway maps from New York, Tokyo, Paris, Barcelona, Sydney and other cities, each available in a dark variant as well.
